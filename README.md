### Similarity-Based-Methods for Link-Prediction
#### Link prediction in networks using similarity-based methods such as Common Neighbors, Jaccard and etc.
This project demonstrates how to perform **link prediction** on graph data using classical **similarity-based algorithms**. These unsupervised methods estimate the likelihood of a future or missing link between two nodes based on network structure.
